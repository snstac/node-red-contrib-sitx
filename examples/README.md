# node-red-contrib-orion Examples

This directory contains many examples using [Orion Node-RED](https://github.com/orion-labs/node-red-contrib-orion) nodes.

# Requirements

Before using these Nodes, you must have an Orion account. We recommend starting off by creating
a basic [Orion Organization](https://shop.orionlabs.io/) so you can manage multiple accounts.

You can also sign up from the free Orion App on your [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/orion-push-to-talk/id984202314) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onbeep.obiwan) Smartphone. You don't have to have the app
to do

Once you have an account, you will need to use the [Orion Management Console](https://login.orionlabs.io).
